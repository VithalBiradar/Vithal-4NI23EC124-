# Experiment - 1 
Analysis of cs amplifier
## Aim:
analyse the Dc analysis, transienr and AC analysis of a CS amplifier circuit and extract the variuos parameters 
associated using LT spice.
## Components are required:
Resistor(1K),voltage supply(1.8v,0.9v) Mosfet(nmos4,pmos4),and connecting wirees.
## Theory:
Mosfet plays a very important role in the electronics.
why we mostly prefer Mosfet as transistor means due to its compact design,lowpower consumpation
