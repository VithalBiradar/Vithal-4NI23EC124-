Analysis of cs amplifier
## Aim:
analyse the Dc analysis, transienr and AC analysis of a CS amplifier circuit and extract the variuos parameters 
associated using LT spice.
## Components are required:
Resistor(1K),voltage supply(1.8v,0.9v) Mosfet(nmos4,pmos4),and connecting wirees.
## Theory:
Mosfet plays a very important role in the electronics.
why we mostly prefer Mosfet as transistor means due to its compact design,low power consumpation,simple 
in the geometry and  adjustable in the size in the VLSI techanolgy.

Mosfet has a four terminals(drain,source,gate,body),And Mosfet has three different configuration can be connected 
through common drain,common gate and common souce the most prefered configuration of the Mosfet is the common source
and common drain because of the amplification in this configuration Mosfet act as a good amplifier.
The Mosfet in the saturation region acts as a good amplifier and the operation condition most be satify these
condition where Vgs>Vth,Vgd<Vth and Vds>=Vov for an N channel mosfet.In the common source configuration there is a 180 degree phase shift between the input and output.
There is very high input impedence that is nearly equal to Ig=0 idealy infinite.
The drain current
Id=1/2kn*Vov*Vov;Vov=Vgs-Vt and Kn=UnCoxW/L
This is the eqation foe the drain current in the saturation region
